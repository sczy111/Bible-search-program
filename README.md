### Project Structure and Details:

#### Key Files:
- **`main.py`**: The main program required to run the project.
- **`usx` folder**: Contains files sourced from [Open Bible Info](https://github.com/openbibleinfo/American-Standard-Version-Bible), which are the American Standard Version (ASV) of the Bible.
- **`Modified_usx_cn` folder**: Contains the Chinese version of the Bible for each book.
- **`Version_update` folder**: Includes the program used to update the English version to the Chinese version.

#### Code Highlights:
The key code segment for the version update process (from `Version_update`) is from **lines 142â€“162**:

```python
# Directory containing the HTML files
html_dir = "E:/filetwo/Bible_documents/Bible/Bible_search/html/NT27revelation/Chapter/"

# Collect all Chinese verses from HTML files
chinese_verses = {}
for chapter_num in range(1, 23):  # Genesis has 50 chapters
    html_file = os.path.join(html_dir, f"NT27rev_{chapter_num}.htm")
    if not os.path.exists(html_file):
        print(f"HTML file not found: {html_file}")
        continue
    chapter_verses = parse_html_chapter(html_file)
    chinese_verses.update(chapter_verses)

# Replace verses in USX tree
usx_tree = replace_verses(usx_tree, verse_elements, chinese_verses)

# Remove English text from the entire USX tree
remove_english_text(root)

# Save the modified USX file
output_usx_file = "66-modified_REV.usx"

## Notes:
The project relies on external sources for Bible data, including the ASV version and Chinese translations.
Contributions are welcome, and updates to support other versions may be added in the future.
